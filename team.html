		When I first began running, it was for the purpose of clearing my head after a long day. It gradually took on more meaning. It became a social outlet; when I’m apart of a team or club, I’m apart of a strong community. The day of my first high school cross country meet, my grandfather passed away. Having always been my personal cheerleader as well as an active person himself, I decided to race and that I would race not for myself, but for him. As I’ve learned, running holds a greater significance that is beyond just for oneself. Through the RRT, I will be running for Alzheimer’s.

      “It doesn't matter whether you're the lion or the gazelle-when the sun comes up, you'd better be running.”
      <br>-Christopher McDougall
<br><br>
Running was a transformative experience for me. It helped me to understand the beauty of early mornings and the focus and hard work it takes in order to achieve a goal. I've met my best friends through running. By embarking on this road trip, and raising awareness and funds for Alzheimer's , I hope to spread the sense of community and support that I've recieved by running. <br><br>

Running is more than a sport. It's a way of life that brings communities together. Growing up in Boulder, Colordo, I've seen this first hand. Now I want to bring this sense of community and empowerment that running can provide to a larger community at scale. I can't think of a better cause for this project to support. I will providing the technical resources to get RRT moving.  <br><br>
